// - [X] cleanup code
// - [X] Add a thing that let's us quickly switch between witch solution is used
// - [X] make our current arm work no matter how it is rotated (calculations need to be in local space)
// - [X] make our current arm work no matter where it is placed
// - [X] would be nice if we had gizmo lines for all joints maybe?
// - [ ] also make upper joint move (keep this one parallel to floor)
// - [ ] add some sort of path/animation for target position maybe
// - [ ] add more arms
// - [ ] iterate on arm design based on what we'll see in the simulated machine
// - [ ] automatically instanciate arms at sensible positions (use parameters)

// - [ ] Need a name for the thing. Some ideas:
//   - u-joint. The UJ-Table
//   - hexapod. The Hexa Bot.
