
// - [ ] cleanup code
// - [ ] would be nice if we had gizmo lines for all joints maybe?
// - [ ] also make upper joint move (keep this one parallel to floor)
// - [ ] add some sort of path/animation for target position maybe
// - [ ] make our current arm work no matter how it is rotated (calculations need to be in local space)
// - [ ] add more arms
// - [ ] Need a name for the thing. Some ideas:
//   - u-joint. The UJ-Table
//   - hexapod. The Hexa Bot.
