// - [X] cleanup code
// - [X] Add a thing that let's us quickly switch between which solution is used
// - [X] make our current arm work no matter how it is rotated (calculations need to be in local space)
// - [X] make our current arm work no matter where it is placed
// - [X] would be nice if we had gizmo lines for all joints maybe?
// - [X] also make upper joint move (keep this one parallel to floor)
// - [X] automatically instanciate arms at sensible positions
//     - [X] instantiate end effector platform on play
//     - [X] instantiate 6 arms on play (setup target positions inside end effector platform)
//     - [X] parameters for easy experimentation:
//           - distance from center for motors pairs at midpoint
//           - distance apart of motor pair
//           - distance from center for target pairs below endeffector at midpoint
//           - distance apart of target pair
// - [X] Fix joints-can't-handle-tilt-problem (need more degrees of freedom for top most joint)
//     - [X] add that debugGizmo method -> (origin, redDir, greenDir, blueDir)
//     - [X] pass in end effector (hexaplate) tilt
//     - [X] FirtStep: Calculate correct realTarget according to tilt
//     - [X] SecondStep: Calculate correct joint angles for joints 4 and 5 according to endEffector tilt
// - [X] Fix last joint not rotating together with tilted platform problem

// - [X] send 6 values instead of 4 to microcontroller
// - [X] handle 6 values and 6 sineSteppers on microcontroller
// - [X] add two more OUTPUTS (for the additional two motors) to the constants file on the microcontroller
// - [X] connect the 6 stepper controllers accordingly
// - [X] Add UI buttons to calibrate each motor (need to adjust rotation in small steps)
// - [X] Add _levelingOffset which is a LLMachineState that will accumulate calibration values for all the motors
// - [X] For normal move instructions, add them to the _levelingOffset to get the real target machine state
// - [X] Need to set the machineState after above calibration as the origin position for the machine
// - [X] All following diff-instructions should be relative to the origin position
// - [X] Add UI buttons to do the following: up/down at different speeds
// - [X] TEST WITH ARMS CONNECTED
// Things we now know after that test:
// - [X] test with NO-feedback-loop (no rotary encoder) stepper driver settings
// - [X] we probably need to put something soft under the arms on startup. Some arms are pushing agains the ground because of the way steppers work.
// - [X] Add apply-calibration button (applies all the values we found to be ideal for each motor)
// - [X] we also want a button that makes the machine go up/down continuously. maybe 10 times with pauses in between (maybe multiple pause intervals?)
// - [X] we want to go up/down even faster
// - [X] we want to go further up and down to a position above origin

// - [ ] We need a way to move the simulatedMachine with HighLevelInstructions.
//     - [X] HighLevelInstruction needs to contain: PlateCenterPosition, PlateRotationQuaternion, MoveTime
//     - [X] We Need a "add pose" button
//     - [X] First goal will be to be able to play-back the recorded HighLevelInstruction
//     - [X] Introduce the concept of a "sequence" (a list of HighLevelInstructions). This will be useful when converting the HighLevelInstructions to stringed LowLevelInstructions.
//     - [X] Add "Playback Stringed" button. When pressed...
//         - [X] ...Create stringed linear HighLevelInstructions in intervals of 0.1 * moveTime for all HighLevelInstructions in the sequence.
//              - [X]  To create the stringed instructions, the IK has to be executed every time the HexaPlate's position changes. Use an Observable to let the IK know that it needs to update.
//              - [X]  Make sure above Observable fires whenever we update the HexaPlate's position/rotation.
//              - [X] After this, it should work like this: Update Hexaplate position/rotation -> IK updates -> We are able to read out all the motor rotations and create a stringed LowLevelInstruction from them.
//         - [X] ...playback the sequence of stringed HighLevelInstructions
//     - [X] add capability to independently log position data every frame. Log all the positions in the CSV format in order to make graphs to check if the linear stringed instructions work as expected.
//     - [X] our logging is a bit shabby; We might get a different number of data points for different playbacks. Fix this. (also log time instead of frame count?)
//     - [X] Move logger in seperate class
//     - [X] Do the same kind of logging for motor rotations (stringed vs unstringed)
//     - [ ] make sure the motorRotations match what the microcontroller is expecting
//           - [X] correct cw/ccw direction
//                - [X] for M1 moving-arm-up-rotation-direction is minus
//                - [X] for M2 moving-arm-up-rotation-direction is plus
//           - [X] correct 0-position (need to check rotation at origin position and use it as offset)
//           - [X] We need to multiply our theta by something to scale the value to the one the microcontroller expects
//     - [X] For some reason, creating stringed instructions playback isn't working with many HLInstructions
//     - [X] Also reset rotation on Teleport to origin.
//     - [X] Add LowLevelMachineStateProvider. Arms need to update their MotorRotation to LowLevelMachineStateProvider everytime the IK executes.
//         - [X] Use the LowLevelMachineState from above provider to do make the LowLevelInstructions.
//     - [X] When creating the stringed HighLevelInstructions, also create LowLevelInstructions by checking the motor position of all the motors after kicking off the IK.
//     - [X] Add button called "Playback stringed on RM"
//     - [X] Make stringed Linear LowLevelInstructions work on the microcontroller (currently we use cos to start/stop smoothly. We will not need that anymore).
//     - [X] Next, create stringed LowLevelInstructions from the sequence (go through data in pairs: "from" HLInstruction, "to" HLInstruction).
//           - To generate them, we move time forward in small steps, check how far each of the motors has moved and create a LowLevelInstruction for each step.
// - [X] The stringed together instructions can basically be executed as linear-speed movements to target pos. We DO of course use a sine-based movement when moving the end effector
//       when generating motor rotations with IK, but the movement commands themselves can be linear speed movements to target position because they will be very short and about 50 for a complete move.
//       The shortness and number of linear-speed moves will ensure that in totality, a smooth movement can be achieved.
// - [X] refactor "SineStepper/SineStepperController" code to "LinearStepper/LinearStepperController" etc.
// - [X] add "Speed x1", "Speed x2", "Speed x3" buttons to the sequencing UI

// Continue work on this â†“
// - [X] check why "apply offset" -> "stringed playback (up and down to origin)" results in a endstate that is not the same as after apply offset (how did we define origin?)
// - [X] is it because the first apply offset wasn't sent correctly? do we need to send 0,0,0,0,0,0 the first time after startup?
//       -> Yes
// - [X] speed is too fast.
// - [X] need to change machineModel parameters to match real machine (distance from center for motors and targets)
// - [ ] test tilting/rotating/translating (don't go too far though, we now know that there are instable states where an arm might flap downwards)

// - [ ] add "send to machine and repeat 5x" button to the sequencing UI

// Thinking:
// - There's a slight problem with how the microcontroller handles moveCommands:
//     - The microcontroller remembers all the current motor positions and calculates the steps needed to reach a target rotation for each motor
//     - The problem is that with the slicing approach, if the machine isn't in the exact state we expect it to be in, the first moveCommand
//       might be at a way too high speed if the target position is too far away.
//     - I don't think there's a ideal solution to fix/improve this though.

// - [ ] test with different stepper driver PID settings
//     -> this might be interesting, especially if we connect the driver to the setup software and look through all the settings,
//        but I'm not sure we'll get anything out of this (going no-feedback-loop might be the best option after all)

// - [ ] change colors of arm parts which are colliding so that we can get a better feeling of how the arm design has to be improved
// - [ ] add some sort of animation for end effector platform
//     - [X] moving up and down
//     - [X] moving left and right
//     - [X] moving forward and backward
//     - [X] circling (position)
//     - [X] circling + up/down (position)
//     - [X] tilting around the X-Axis
//     - [ ] tilting around the Z-Axis
//     - [ ] circling (tilt)
//     - [ ] moving up and down at left/right/front/back position
// - [ ] iterate on arm design based on what we'll see in the simulated machine
// - [ ] center gizmo would be nice, so we can tell how far away from center the hexaplate is
// - [ ] maybe switch project to the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) with demo scene as base for better visual look
// - [ ] Need a name for the thing. Some ideas:
//   - u-joint. The UJ-Table
//   - hexapod. The Hexa Bot.

// Thing to check:
// - Wouldn't it also work if the 6 arms were placed one at a time at 60deg intervals instead of pairwise in 120deg intervals?


// HOW TO USE:
//     1. Press Unity Editor's play button
//     2. Press Apply Offset button; The physical machine should now be in exactly the same state as the virtual machine
//     3. Move HexaPlate, AddHLInstruction, Teleport to origin, AddHLInstruction, PlaybackStringed


// CHANGELOG
// - 2025-07-14: Tightened nuts on last joint (where the arm is connected to the hexaplate) for better rigidity.
// - 2025-07-14: No PID (open loop) seems better.
