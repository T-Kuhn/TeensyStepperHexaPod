# Experiments to investigate characteristics of instable poses
## Tilt with centered hexaplate
 - Experiment: +/- 15deg around X at height 0.25
   - Result: both stable
 - Experiment: +/- 20deg around X at height 0.25
   - Result: -20deg around X at height 0.25 was very close to unstable pose
   - Result: 20deg around X at height 0.25 was stable
 - Experiment: +/- 15deg around Z at height 0.25
   - Result: both stable
 - Experiment: +/- 20deg around Z at height 0.25
   - Result: both seemed fairly close to unstable pose
 - Experiment: +/- 22deg around Z at height 0.25
   - Result: both seemed fairly close to unstable pose
 - Experiment: +/- 25deg around Z at height 0.25
   - Result: both seemed close to unstable pose
 - Experiment: +/- 20deg around Y at height 0.25
   - Result: both stable at all speeds
 - Experiment: +/- 25deg around Y at height 0.25
   - Result: both seemed slightly unstable

## Translation with un-tilted hexaplate
 - Experiment: +/- 0.1 along Z at height 0.25
   - Result: 0.1deg along Z at height 0.25 was close to unstable pose
 - Experiment: +/- 0.05 along Z at height 0.25
   - Result: both stable
 - Experiment: +/- 0.1 along X at height 0.25
   - Result: both seemed close to unstable pose
 - Experiment: +/- 0.05 along X at height 0.25
   - Result: both stable
 - Experiment: +/- 0.05 along X and Z at height 0.25
 - Experiment: both stable. But there seemed to be increased play at both

 ## Translate && up/down off-center

 - Experiment: go + 0.1 along Z at height 0.25, then go up/down 0.05
   - Result: no instability at all speeds

 ## Tilt && up/down
 - Experiment: - 15deg around X at height 0.25, then go up/down 0.05
   - Result: no instability, but tilt pose at lower position was more stable/there was less play compared to tilt pose at high position
 - Experiment: - 20deg around Y at height 0.25, then go up/down 0.05
   - Result: no instability at all speeds

## Tilt && Translation
 - Experiment: -10deg around X at height 0.2, then go to 0.25 with Z 0.1
   - Result: UNSTABLE. Was about to collapse.
 - Experiment: -10deg around X at height 0.2, then go to +/- 0.05 along Z
   - Result: close to instability with quite a lot of play
